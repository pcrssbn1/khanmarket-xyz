<details class="card">
<summary>What is Khan Market?</summary>
<p>Khan Market is a shopping and commercial district in New Delhi, India, established in 1951 and named after Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan. It consists of approximately 100 shops arranged in two parallel rows, creating a compact, walkable retail environment. The market specializes in upscale boutiques, bookstores, restaurants, and cafes rather than traditional market goods. It has evolved from a neighborhood shopping area serving nearby diplomatic enclaves into one of Delhi's premier retail destinations, ranking among the world's most expensive retail locations by rental cost. The market maintains a village-like atmosphere despite its premium positioning, with independent shops and longtime establishments coexisting with newer trendy venues.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>Where is Khan Market located?</summary>
<p>Khan Market is situated in central New Delhi at coordinates approximately 28.6004° N, 77.2275° E, in the area bounded by Sujan Singh Park and Lodhi Colony. The market sits near the intersection of Lodhi Road and Bhagwan Das Road, placing it within 2 kilometers of India Gate and 1.5 kilometers from Lodhi Gardens. The nearest metro station, also named Khan Market, opened on the Violet Line in 2014 and sits approximately 400 meters from the market's main entrance. This central location, surrounded by diplomatic missions, government offices, and affluent residential neighborhoods, has contributed significantly to the market's upscale character and consistent foot traffic throughout the week.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>What can you buy at Khan Market?</summary>
<p>Khan Market offers designer clothing from boutiques like Anokhi and Good Earth, books from Bahrisons and Full Circle, ayurvedic cosmetics from Biotique, prescription eyewear from Dayal Opticals, home decor and lighting from stores like Mr Light and Out of the Box, and gourmet food items from Cona's deli. FabIndia provides organic foods and traditional textiles, while specialty shops sell jewelry, handicrafts, stationery, and gifts. Unlike traditional Indian markets selling commodities and everyday goods, Khan Market focuses on curated, often premium products. You won't find electronics, bulk groceries, or discount clothing here. The market caters to shoppers seeking quality, uniqueness, and brand names rather than bargain prices, with most items reflecting this positioning in their pricing.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>Is Khan Market expensive?</summary>
<p>Khan Market ranks among Delhi's most expensive shopping areas, with retail rents reaching $229 per square foot annually as of 2018, making it the 20th costliest retail location globally according to Cushman & Wakefield research. These high operational costs translate to premium pricing across most establishments. A meal for two at mid-range restaurants costs 1,500-2,500 rupees compared to 600-1,000 rupees at typical Delhi restaurants. Clothing from boutiques ranges from 2,000-15,000 rupees per garment versus 500-3,000 rupees at regular stores. Books carry standard pricing, but specialty items, imported goods, and designer products command significant premiums. The market's expensive reputation is well-deserved and reflects its positioning as an upscale destination rather than a value shopping option.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>What are the best restaurants in Khan Market?</summary>
<p>Khan Chacha stands out for authentic North Indian kebabs and rolls since 1972, with meals under 400 rupees for two people, offering exceptional value. Smokehouse Deli provides contemporary comfort food and an extensive menu in a stylish setting, averaging 1,800 rupees for two. Perch Wine & Coffee Bar combines modern Indian small plates with wines, ideal for evening dining around 2,500 rupees. Big Chill remains popular for Italian-American fare and desserts since 2000. Town Hall offers upscale Mediterranean dining at approximately 2,800 rupees. For cafes, Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters serves specialty coffee roasted on-site, while Cafe Turtle above Full Circle Bookstore provides continental breakfast in a literary atmosphere. Each restaurant has developed a distinct identity and loyal following, so the 'best' choice depends on cuisine preferences and budget.</p>

<details class="card">
<summary>How do I get to Khan Market by metro?</summary>
<p>Take the Violet Line of the Delhi Metro to Khan Market station, which opened in October 2014. From Kashmere Gate in Old Delhi, board a Violet Line train toward Escorts Mujesar and reach Khan Market in approximately 20 minutes with 8 intermediate stops. From the airport, take the Airport Express to New Delhi station, transfer to the Yellow Line toward HUDA City Centre, change at Central Secretariat to the Violet Line toward Escorts Mujesar, and reach Khan Market in about 50 minutes total. Exit the metro station using Gate 2, which places you closest to the market entrance. Walk approximately 400 meters northeast along Subramaniam Bharti Marg for about 5 minutes to reach the main market area. Metro fares range from 10-60 rupees depending on distance, with smart cards offering slight discounts over tokens.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>When is the best time to visit Khan Market?</summary>
<p>Weekday mornings between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM offer the most comfortable shopping experience with lighter crowds, available parking, and full shop operations. Late weekday afternoons after 4:00 PM also work well, particularly for combining shopping with dinner at restaurants. Avoid Saturday afternoons when crowds peak, parking becomes nearly impossible, and the narrow lanes grow congested with shoppers and diners. Sunday mornings provide moderate traffic but some shops open later. During monsoon season (July-September), covered walkways offer protection but humidity increases. Winter months (November-February) provide the most pleasant weather for walking between shops, with temperatures between 10-25°C. Summer months (April-June) see temperatures exceeding 40°C, making early morning or evening visits more comfortable.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>Is Khan Market related to Khan el Khalili in Cairo?</summary>
<p>No, Khan Market in New Delhi and Khan el Khalili in Cairo are completely unrelated despite the similar 'Khan' naming. Khan Market takes its name from Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, a Pashtun independence activist whose brother Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan worked alongside Mahatma Gandhi. The market was established in 1951 as a modern shopping complex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_el-Khalili">Khan el Khalili, established in 1382 during the Mamluk era, is a historic bazaar in Islamic Cairo named after the Emir Djaharks el-Khalili.</a> The two markets differ fundamentally in character: Khan el Khalili is a sprawling traditional Middle Eastern souk selling souvenirs, spices, and handicrafts with extensive bargaining, while Khan Market is a compact, upscale shopping district with fixed prices and boutique stores. The naming similarity is purely coincidental.</p>
</details>

<details class="card">
<summary>Does Khan Market have anything to do with Khan Academy stock market content?</summary>
<p>Khan Market has no connection to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain">Khan Academy, the educational platform founded by Sal Khan in 2008. Khan Academy offers free online courses including financial literacy and stock market education, covering topics like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and investment strategies.</a> The naming similarity is coincidental—Khan Market is named after Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, a historical figure in India's independence movement, while Khan Academy takes its name from its founder Salman Khan, an American educator of Bangladeshi descent. Khan Market is a physical retail location in Delhi focused on shopping and dining, not education or financial services. While you can purchase books about investing at Khan Market's bookstores like Bahrisons, the market itself provides no stock market education or financial advisory services.</p>
